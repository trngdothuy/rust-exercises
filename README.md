Hello, this is my folder of Rust programming exercises.
I've done them while self-studying online.

This folder contains 28 exercises and 2 projects. 
The 1st project is an Interactive Bill Manager allowing users to add bills and manage their purchases. 
The 2nd project is a Contact Manage permitting users to view, add, search and edit saved contacts.
